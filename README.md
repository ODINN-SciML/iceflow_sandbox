# ODINN.jl iceflow sandbox

Ice flow model experiments for OGGM-ODINN. Currently under development by Lucille Gimenes.

Current developments:

Accelerating ice flow simulations in OGGM with Julia
- Coupling a 1D Shallow Ice Approximation model in Julia to OGGM.
- Coupling a 2D Shallow Ice Approximation from ODINN.jl to OGGM.
